#UIL-API
API Implementation and frontend of the UIL Scoring website since they apparently don't have a front-facing API.
#Why does this exist
The UIL website is really weird. They seemingly don't have an API, but instead scores are stored on a remote server and an XHTML file is automatically generated by some PHP service on the serverside. This makes accessing the data pretty challenging, because you have to interpret the XHTML given instead.
#So, what exactly does this do?
This "API" interprets the XHTML generated by the remote server and compiles it into JSON exported by a Spring Boot Application. It can currently pull user scores, schools, and ranks. The frontend is just a small frontend (that i'd reason is better than the official website) with support for calculating odds of winning and calculating scores. This is the part that I'm working on expanding most.
#Why is this code so bad
Okay, this code is garbage. I'm not even gonna dance around that. But it'll probably work for your needs?
#How do I use this API?
The API has three outward facing functions, but I'm planning on simplifying that into two functions.
First, there's *getScore* which will return the score of whatever parameters are supplied. This requires 5 parameters; subject, region, conf, year, and district. Example of usage: /getScore?subject=CSC&region=20&conf=2A&year=2021&district=D this code would return the scores for Computer Science in District 20 for the District meet in 2021.
*getEvents* returns the events plus the proper names of the events, under the names "events" and "words" respectively. This requires no parameters.
Last but not least is *getAllEvents*, this is not finished being implemented, but it's planned to be used to get all scores in all events for one district by an individual. This isn't finished yet.
#Where can I use this tool?
Well, I would host it myself, but my internet is too worthless to do that. So, I'm looking for a webhosting solution if anyone actually cares about this tool.
